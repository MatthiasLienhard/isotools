Command line interface
**********************
.. argparse::
   :module: isotools.run_isotools
   :func: argument_parser
   :prog: run_isotools
   
   While IsoTools is designed to be run interactivly (e.g. in a python notebook, or in the repl), 
   it can also be run as a command line tool, with predefined parameters. 
   This may be convenient to process different experiments in a standardized pipeline. 
   For example usage, see the `CLI tutorial <notebooks/02_api_vs_cli.html>`_.
